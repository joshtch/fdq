Woops... It seems \`npm test\` failed somehow. Please resolve any issues before committing.
Prefix your commit command line with \`FORCE_BROKEN_COMMIT=1\` if you want to force this anyways, for temporary commits.
If you want to do a partial commit make sure to stash other changes before committing.
- \`git stash -k\` will not stash staged changed (stuff from \`git add\` / \`git diff --cached\`)
- \`git stash -u\` will also stash new files
- \`git stash -uk\` will stash new files and ignore staged changed
In a bright future this script will do this for you before applying tests, but not yet.
